## Catarina Roman

Hello!

I am Catarina, a 4th-year Political Science Ph.D. candidate at UC San Diego.

I am broadly interested in Political Economy and Comparative Politics, with a regional focus on Latin America. 
My dissertation revolves around compulsory voting laws and other reforms that affect electoral behavior.
I am motivated by the challenges democracies face by design, such as low and unequal participation and disproportional representation.
